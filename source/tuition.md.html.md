Tuition
=======

Overnight Camper - $585 per Camper\
 Day Camper - $440 per Camper

A $100 **non-refundable** deposit must accompany all applications.

Please review our [Refund Policy](/refund-policy).

### If you choose to change your status from an overnight camper to a day camper, or vice-versa, a $30 administrative fee will be added to your balance.

For example: If a camper has paid $440 to be a day camper, then decides
to switch to an overnight camper (assuming spots remain), they would be
charged the $145 difference, plus the $30 administrative fee for a total
of $175.

If a camper has paid $585 to be an overnight camper, then decides to
switch to a day camper, they would be charged the $30 administrative fee
from the amount they've over paid, and therefore refunded a total of
$115.

Sorry, there are no team or group rates.
