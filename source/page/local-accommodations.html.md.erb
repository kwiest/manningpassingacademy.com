Local Accommodations
====================

Off-Campus Accommodations
-------------------------

There are ample accommodations in the local community that can be
secured by visiting the [Bayou Region Accommodations](http://travel.ian.com/hotel/searchresults?currencyCode=USD&userCity=null,null,null&additionalDataString=vrBookingSource%7Cnull&locale=en_US&searchParam=3CE44484-F4A4-44D2-8F2A-FA2896A15806&searchType=DESTINATION&cid=268128)
page.

Sorry, but due to insurance issues, we are unable to provide on-campus
housing to anyone other than the resident campers; and then only for the
specific dates that camp is in session.

We do welcome all spectators during the practice sessions, but for legal
and safety reasons, we ask that you refrain from entering the dining,
common, and sleeping areas.
