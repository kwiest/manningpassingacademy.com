Evening Speakers
================

The Manning Passing Academy conducts evening speaker sessions that are headlined
by professionals who will teach our campers that life is more than just the
fundamentals they need to know on the football field. We provide sessions on
character building, academics and the myriad issues surrounding their health in
the demanding sport of football. It is important to us that high school
athletes know that a college degree will get them further in life than just
football by itself. But they can use football to help them achieve goals that
might otherwise not exist. Throughout the camp we hope to instill habits,
discipline and structure that our campers can use throughout their life
regardless of when their football careers end. The camp's highly-structured
daily schedule and regimen is always topped off with our evening speaker
sessions that are intended to impart the importance of education and teamwork
and convey that the most successful athlete should also embrace an even balance
of physical, mental, spiritual and emotional well-being.

Pro Player Roundtable
---------------------

This must see forum is presented by our in-residence NFL players and coaches who
will provide a unique insight what benefits can received and what sacrifices
must be made to make it to the professional level. And also the harsh reality
of how few actually make it to that level which truly reveals how important a
college degree is.

Cooper's College Colloquium
---------------------------

Everything you wanted to know about college football but were afraid to ask. The
Colloquium has traditionally been the camper's favorite seminar. Eldest son
Cooper Manning emcees a panel of accomplished college football players and
conducts an interactive question and answer session between the high school
athletes and the collegians.

NCAA Initial Eligibility Seminar
--------------------------------

Staff members from the NCAA conduct seminars geared towards educating high
school football players who intend to continue participating as players in the
college ranks. They share the core courses they must take and the resources that
the NCAA makes available to assist them in achieving that goal.

Thibodaux Regional Medical Center Forum
---------------------------------------

The TRMC will provide highly qualified medical personnel who will instruct our
campers on the potential injuries that exist in the game of football and what to
look for. Everything from concussions, shoulder injuries, bacterial infections,
and more will be covered during this session. The TRMC also provides the
certified trainers that tend to our campers on a daily basis and is located
adjacent to our practice fields.

Gatorade Nutritional Session
----------------------------

The MPA's longest standing partner wants to ensure that our campers are fully
prepared for the rigors of camp and the upcoming football season. Towards that
end their professional staff will discuss sports nutrition myths and facts and
also the foods and fluids that are important to help fuel your body and help you
stay healthy and allow you the opportunity for the greatest success.

Absolutely no parents or adults allowed!
----------------------------------------

All evening speaker sessions are provided to the campers only.
