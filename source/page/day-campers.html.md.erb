Day Campers
===========

Day Campers are treated the same as Overnight Campers with a few minor
exceptions:

* Day campers are provided two meals per day (lunch and dinner).
  A locker room (for showering purposes only) is provided after
  practice sessions.
* There are no secured lockers, but campers may leave their bags in
  the camp office in between practices. However, this is simply an
  area to store their belongings, and *the MPA is not responsible for
  lost or stolen items.*
* Day campers are welcome to stay throughout the evening activities
  right up until they are done (approximately 10:00pm).
