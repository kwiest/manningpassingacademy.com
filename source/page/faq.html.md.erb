Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Q.** What is the best method to communicate with the camp to get my questions
answered?  
**A.** First and foremost … read the FAQs. Over the years we’ve accumulated the
most asked questions. Secondly use email. You will get the fastest response from
email versus leaving a message on voicemail. Typically emails will get a
response within 12 hours or less.

**Q.** Can I choose my roommate?  
**A.** No. The MPA will choose all roommates for all campers. Campers will be
paired with others of similar age. We find that this allows for campers to make
more friends and it assists us with discipline and structure in the dormitories.
To be fair, there are no exceptions.

**Q.** My teammate(s) are also coming to camp; can we be on the same 7-on-7
team?  
**A.** Yes! We will always do our best to group players coming from the same
school together. However, our teams are also determined by grade, and under no
circumstances will a player move up a level. If players would like to move down,
we will allow it.

**Q.** Do I need to bring my own football?  
**A.** Not if you register online. Spalding has been generous enough to provide
a TF-SB1 football for each camper (a $100 value).  You can still bring your own
football if you prefer. It is important that you are comfortable with your grip
on the ball.

**Q.** I’m an overnight camper, what do I need to bring with me?  
**A.** All overnight campers must provide their own bedding; sleeping bags are
recommended. Rooms include a bed and mattress for each camper, but you must
provide your own towels, wash cloths, and any other toiletries.

**Q.** I'm an overnight camper, what should I NOT bring with me?  
**A.** We recommend that you do NOT bring anything of value (jewelry, radios,
substantial amounts of cash, TVs, etc.). We cannot vouch for everyone who
attends camp. Everyone must be vigilant regarding security and safety. That
means always lock your door and put your name on everything.

**Q.** Are there laundry facilities on-site?  
**A.** Yes. But you should bring your own laundry detergent and change to
operate the machines.

**Q.** I don't understand which grade I should put, can you explain it?  
**A.** We group teams and dorm assignments according to what grade you will be
entering in the **fall of after the MPA is complete**. Please do not enter your
current grade, but only the grade you’ll be entering.

**Q.** How do I get to the Nicholls State's campus?  
**A.** Please see our [Directions to Camp](/page/directions) page for driving
directions. We also offer an [Airport Shuttle](/page/airport-shuttle) that runs
to/from the airport to campus.

**Q.** Will all of the Mannings be at the camp?  
**A.** Yes! Archie, Cooper, Peyton, and Eli are the first to arrive and the last
to leave. They live right on campus with the campers and eat in the same dining
hall. They will all actively oversee a staff of more than 120 coaches and 40
administrations (maintaining a camper-to-coach ratio of 10:1).

**Q.** Will there be an autograph session?  
**A.** No. Although celebrities attend the MPA, this is not a celebrity camp.
The Manning Passing Academy prides itself on being a "working" football camp.
The focus of our staff is to improve each camper’s skills so that they leave
camp a better football player than when they arrived.  Autographs can become a
sideshow and we ask all campers and staff (and spectators) to refrain from
making autograph requests.

**Q.** I just graduated high school, can I still attend?  
**A.** No. The camp is only available to campers entering grades 8-12 and who
have not yet graduated high school.

**Q.** Do I need to Medical Insurance to attend the MPA?  
**A.** Yes. All campers must be covered by insurance to attend the camp. You
CANNOT attend without it. If you do not have insurance you should ask your high
school coach what options may exist. In addition a parental or guardian release
is required for all campers. Please see the [Medical
Information](/page/medical-information) page for full details.

**Q.** Do I need to complete a physical before attending camp?  
**A.** No. Medical insurance and a Waiver Release is all that is required.

**Q.** How do I know if I’m confirmed and my application is accepted?  
**A.** All campers will receive an automatic confirmation email after their
application is processed. Because this is an automated email, they sometimes get
caught by SPAM filters. Due to this, we also offer a [Confirmation
Page](<%= confirmation_link %>).

**Q.** Is transportation available to get to camp?  
**A.** There is an Airport Shuttle (offered by a private company) that is
available to transport campers to/from New Orleans International Airport (MSY)
on the first day of camp (Thursday) and then back to the airport on the last day
of camp (Sunday). The Airport Hilton across the street from the New Orleans
International Airport (MSY) is the base for the shuttle. Staff members will meet
your camper at the luggage carousel when they arrive. Sorry we cannot provide
transportation to/from the bus or train station. However, they can take a taxi
to the Airport Hilton in Kenner and catch the Airport Shuttle. See our link to
the [Shuttle Transportation](/page/airport-shuttle).

**Q.** Do I need to bring a helmet?  
**A.** No. Other than cleats and a mouthpiece, there are no equipment
requirements at the MPA.

**Q.** Can parents attend any of the practice sessions?  
**A.** Absolutely. Spectators are always welcome to watch all practices and 7 on
7 drills … as long as they stay outside of the security barriers (re: insurance
liability).

**Q.** Can parents attend the evening speaker sessions?  
**A.** Sorry they cannot. We want to make sure that campers interact with
speakers without feeling self-conscious because adults are in the room and there
is no room to accommodate both campers and parents anyway.

**Q.** How do I find local accommodations in the Nicholls State/Thibodaux area?  
**A.** The local Thibodaux Chamber of Commerce offers a link to local
accommodations. See [Local Accommodations](/page/local-accommodations). Sorry
but the MPA is not in a position to provide accommodations or recommend any
properties.

**Q.** Do I get my money back if I cancel?  
**A.** You would get all of your money back **except the non-refundable $100
deposit**. The camp hires a large number of coaches to provide instruction based
on expected attendance. The reason is when you cancel, we still have to
compensate the coaches we’ve hired.

**Q.** What if I have a medical condition? Who should I tell?  
**A.** It depends upon the condition. If you have dietary requirements you
should email us as soon as possible so we can discuss the situation with the
dining hall. Most (if not all) situations are remedied to the satisfaction of
the camper. If you need to take medication (or it needs to be refrigerated) you
should consult with our medical staff during check-in. They are available at the
front of the line. Understand, it is your responsibility to address these
concerns upon arrival so that we can assist you.

**Q.** What coaches will be at the camp?  
**A.** Due to the fact that there is so much movement in the football coaching
profession, we are unable to provide a list of staff members until camp and
represent all levels of football (professional, college and high school). Rest
assured they will always be of the highest quality available.
