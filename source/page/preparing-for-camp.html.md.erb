Preparing for Camp
==================

* Make sure that all of your information (name, grade, email address,
  contact numbers, etc.) is correct on the
  [confirmation page](https://campregistrationsystems.com/manning-passing-academy/2015-manning-passing-academy/confirmation)
  page so that you are grouped correctly during drills and 7 on 7.
* All balances must be paid in full by May 15 or else you may incur a
  $100 late fee or be dropped from the rolls. No exceptions.
* All overnight campers must provide their own bedding; sleeping bags
  are recommended. You must also provide your own towels, wash cloths,
  and any other toiletries you need. Go to [room and board](/page/room-and-board).
* You do NOT need football equipment but we recommend a mouth piece
  for all campers. Grass-cleated shoes are highly recommended to
  tennis shoes but you should bring both in case in climate weather
  forces us inside. See [equipment](/page/equipment).
* We recommend that you do NOT bring anything of value (jewelry,
  radios, substantial amounts of cash, TVs, etc.). We cannot vouch on
  the honesty for everyone who attends camp. Everyone must be vigilant
  regarding security and safety. That means always lock your door and
  put your name on everything.
* If you need to utilize the airport shuttle transportation we offer
  to/from camp make sure you secure reservations early so you have a
  seat. Go to [airport shuttle](/page/airport-shuttle) in the web site.
* If you are a DAY CAMPER (i.e. commuter) and you are looking for a
  hotel in the camp area you should visit our [local accommodations](/local-accommodations)
  link which will connect you with the Thibodaux Chamber of Commerce.
  Sorry we cannot coordinate housing for Day Campers.
* If you are travelling on your own to Nicholls State and need
  directions to camp go to our [directions](/page/directions) link and it
  will give you GPS coordinates.
* The [check-in process](/check-in-process) for all campers (Overnight
  and Day) is the same. We commence check-in precisely at 1pm on
  Thursday at Stopher Gym. There is no need to show up early because
  we will never start check-in any earlier than 1:00 PM.
* If you have [medical needs](/page/medical-information)
  be sure to communicate them with our camp administration so that they
  can direct you properly.
