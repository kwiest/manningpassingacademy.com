Teams & Group Rates
===================

We welcome and encourage coaches who want to bring the offensive skill
players on their teams. You will have the opportunity to have your squad
practice together during passing league competition in the evenings.

The Manning Passing Academy is now offering an opportunity for high school teams
to participate _as a team_ at the MPA at a reduced tuition rate based and
calculated on the number of players who attend. The more players a high school
team brings the less you pay. The Head Coach will also have the opportunity to
oversee and coach his team’s 7 on 7 sessions and will be employed as a member of
the MPA Staff as a position coach during individual periods.

This is also a great opportunity for high school coaches to interact with their
peers, network with college and professional coaches and players and learn the
basic fundamental skills and techniques needed to coach their players to perform
at the highest level at the offensive skill positions of WR, TE, RB and QB.

In order to register as a “TEAM” the Head Football Coach or high school Athletic
Director must communicate directly with the MPA Camp Office.

**Online registration is not available for teams.**

### Team Rates:

<%= partial 'team_rates' %>

*Note: Some campers would prefer to play at a higher grade-level than
the one they are in. The MPA cannot assess the skill level of a player
relative to campers of a different grade-level during camp. Therefore, a
camper will NOT be allowed to move up. However, if a camper feels that
they should be in a lower level, due to ability, experience, or because
younger teammates are in attendance, we will allow it.*
