Medical Information
===================

### Campers Must Have Their Own Medical Insurance (as primary coverage) to Attend This Camp

Campers who fail to provide proof of coverage will not be allowed to
participate. Simply fill out the requested information regarding
insurance carrier, policy or group number, and I.D.

**You do NOT have to have a physical prior to attending camp.** You DO
have to have your parents or legal guardian sign and submit the
waiver/release from liability statement (included with application).
Certified athletic trainers are in attendance at every practice and in
the residence halls during the evening to ensure the health and safety
of all of our campers. The university’s state-of-the-art training
facilities are available to treat all minor injuries and illnesses.
Local hospitals can treat any emergency.
