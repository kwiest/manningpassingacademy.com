Refunds
=======

All $100 deposits are NON-REFUNDABLE
------------------------------------

The $100 NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT is a guarantee of your availability to
attend this football camp. Based upon your guarantee we hire more than
125 professional coaches to maintain our (better than) 10:1 camper to
coach ratio. The administrative cost of operating a camp is affected
every time a camper signs up… and then cancels. The forfeiture of
deposits due to cancelation offsets the administrative cost incurred by
processing campers and the hiring of staff and allows the MPA to keep
tuition affordable. There are NO EXCEPTIONS. There are no refunds of the
$100 NON-REFUNDABLE deposits, even for medical reasons.

Your tuition must be paid in full BEFORE May 1. If it is not, you will
automatically be assessed a $100 late fee. If you cancel, you will lose
the $100 non-refundable deposit… but will be refunded all monies that
you have paid beyond that.

**If YOU CANCEL AFTER JUNE 1, THERE ARE NO REFUNDS.**

Refunds will not be processed until after August 1, and then only after
a written request has been submitted.

**Online Registration Fee**
-------------------------------

For campers who register online, a $20 non-refundable registration fee is added.
This fee goes to a third party who helps the MPA accept payments online.
