Teams
=====

We welcome and encourage coaches who want to bring the offensive skill
players on their teams. You will have the opportunity to have your squad
practice together during passing league competition in the evenings.

Sorry, but there are no team discounts.

*Note: Some campers would prefer to play at a higher grade-level than
the one they are in. The MPA cannot assess the skill level of a player
relative to campers of a different grade-level during camp. Therefore, a
camper will NOT be allowed to move up. However, if a camper feels that
they should be in a lower level, due to ability, experience, or because
younger teammates are in attendance, we will allow it.*
