Speed Seminar
=============

On Thursday evening, the expert training staff from D1 Sports Training
and Therapy will conduct a performance enhancing seminar for all
campers. D1 Sports is continuously developing and refining the most
current training techniques, enabling athletes to increase their overall
speed, strength, explosiveness, agility, and sport-specific ability.
Their speed development curriculum techniques were developed and refined
by strength and conditioning coaches who are well-known as leaders in
the industry. The MPA philosophy towards performance enhancement is...
*"If we are going to ask you to run... we want to start by showing you
how."* This seminar is offered as a complimentary addition to your MPA
experience.
