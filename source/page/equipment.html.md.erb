Equipment
=========

<%= image_tag 'equipment.jpg', class: 'img-responsive img-thumbnail' %>

This is a NON-CONTACT football camp and therefore there are NO equipment
requirementsâ€¦ but there are minimal needs. Grass cleats are preferable
to tennis shoes but campers should bring **both cleats and tennis
shoes**.

Mouthpieces are always recommended and encouraged. All campers should
also bring a minimal of a three-times-daily change of socks, shorts and
T-shirts.

Typically, when a student-athlete attends a football camp, he receives a
T-shirt.

Due to the generosity of our [sponsors](/page/sponsors), MPA campers will
receive multiple gifts including T-Shirts, caps, a water bottle, a gym bag, a
key lanyard and much, much more!  

Please visit and support our [sponsors](/page/sponsors) who make these gifts
possible.
