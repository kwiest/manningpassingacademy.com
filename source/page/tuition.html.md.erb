Tuition
=======

Registration for the 2017 MPA will open October 1
-------------------------------------------------

* **Overnight camper:** <%= number_to_currency overnight_tuition %> per camper
* **Day camper:** <%= number_to_currency day_tuition %> per camper

*A $100 **non-refundable** deposit must accompany all applications.*

Please review our [Refund Policy](/page/refund-policy).

If you choose to change your status from an overnight camper to a day
camper, or vice-versa, a $30.00 administrative fee will be added to your balance.

For example: If a camper has paid <%= number_to_currency day_tuition %>
to be a day camper, then decides to switch to an overnight camper
(assuming spots remain), they would be charged the <%= number_to_currency(overnight_tuition - day_tuition) %>
difference, plus the $30.00 administrative fee for a total of
<%= number_to_currency(overnight_tuition - day_tuition + 30) %>

If a camper has paid <%= number_to_currency overnight_tuition %> to be an
overnight camper, then decides to switch to a day camper, they would be
charged the $30.00 administrative fee from the amount they've over paid,
and therefore refunded a total of <%= number_to_currency(overnight_tuition - day_tuition - 30) %>

Sorry, there are no team or group rates.
