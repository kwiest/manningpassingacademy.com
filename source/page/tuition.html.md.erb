## Changing Status

If you choose to change your status from an overnight camper to a day
camper, or vice-versa, a $30.00 administrative fee will be added to your balance.

For example: If a camper has paid <%= number_to_currency day_tuition %>
to be a day camper, then decides to switch to an overnight camper
(assuming spots remain), they would be charged the <%= number_to_currency(overnight_tuition - day_tuition) %>
difference, plus the $30.00 administrative fee for a total of
<%= number_to_currency(overnight_tuition - day_tuition + 30) %>

If a camper has paid <%= number_to_currency overnight_tuition %> to be an
overnight camper, then decides to switch to a day camper, they would be
charged the $30.00 administrative fee from the amount they've over paid,
and therefore refunded a total of <%= number_to_currency(overnight_tuition - day_tuition - 30) %>
