Facilities
==========

The MPA utilizes all the residence halls, practice fields, theatres,
meeting rooms, and dining facilities that Nicholls State has to offer.
Everything is within a close walking distance (5 minutes) of each other,
and everything is first-class.

Maps of the Nicholls State campus can be found [here](/page/campus-map).
