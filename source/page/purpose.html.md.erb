Purpose
=======

To create an environment of greater understanding of, and the
proficiency with, the fundamentals, techniques, skills, motivation and
sportsmanship necessary for success at the individual offensive skill
positions in the sport of football, while expanding the overall
knowledge and strategy of offensive play and defensive coverage.

For almost four decades the Manning family and the quarterback position
have been practically synonymous with one another. As such, their summer
vacations always revolve the annual Manning Passing Academy...a
family-owned and managed football camp that embraces the basic
fundamentals of football while catering to the offensive skill positions
of RB, TE, WR...and of course QB.
