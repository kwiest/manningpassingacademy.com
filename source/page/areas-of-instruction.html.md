* **The Spread Offense** - In addition to the traditional Pro-Style
offense we will introduce elements of the Spread Offense that is the
latest trend in college football. The Spread maximizes speed in
space and makes the defense defend the entire field. The defense
must also declare their intentions and that allows the offense to
take what the D gives you. The other great aspect of the Spread
Offense is that it provides you the opportunity to potentially
utilize all of your playmakers on every play. And as always, itâ€™s
all about tempo.
