Room and Board
==============

Housing
-------

All overnight campers will stay in one of Nicholls State University's
fine residence halls. Bedding is NOT furnished. As such, overnight
campers must provide their own bedding (sleeping bags are suggested).
All rooms are air-conditioned and come with beds and mattresses.
However, all campers will need to provide their own towels, wash cloths
and any other toiletry articles (soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc.) that
they may need. The MPA reseves the right to make all [roommate assignments.](/page/roommates)

Although there are obviously no accommodations for commuter campers… a
shower facility will be made available after each practice session.
Towels and soap are the responsibility of the campers.

Dining
------

Both Overnight campers and Day campers will eat at Nicholls State’s
outstanding dining facility. Overnight campers receive three (3) meals a
day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and Day campers get two (2) meals a
day (lunch and dinner).

See the [daily schedule](/page/daily-schedule) for specific times.

Day Campers from out of town - find information about
[accommodations](/page/local-accommodations).

McDonalds will be sponsoring a meal for all campers Thursday night after
registration.

Campers will be able to purchase snack foods and pizza during their free
time in the evening.
