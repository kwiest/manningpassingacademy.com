Roommates
=========

### THE MPA RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE ALL ROOM AND ROOMMATE ASSIGNMENTS.

We feel that campers will benefit from the maturation process and it
will assist us in maintaining discipline in the residence halls.
Roommates will be selected and housed in residence halls randomly by
grade level.

All residence halls have adult supervision 24 hours a day. The MPA also
has 4 law enforcement officers on staff 24 hours a day.

There are **NO EXCEPTIONS**
