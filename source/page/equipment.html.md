Equipment
=========

![image](/media/4e81dcf08dac2-equipment_example.jpg)

This is a NON-CONTACT football camp and therefore there are NO equipment
requirementsâ€¦ but there are minimal needs. Grass cleats are preferable
to tennis shoes but campers should bring **both cleats and tennis
shoes**.

Mouthpieces are always recommended and encouraged. All campers should
also bring a minimal of a three-times-daily change of socks, shorts and
T-shirts.

Typically, when a student-athlete attends a football camp, he receives a
T-shirt.

Due to the generosity of our [sponsors](/sponsors), MPA campers will
receive 2 T-shirts, a pair of shorts, 2 caps, a water bottle, a gym bag,
key lanyard, play-call sleeve, towel, wristband, and a commemorative DVD
at the end of camp\*.

\*After camper returns dorm key. A $45 value!\*

Those campers who register online will also receive a [Spalding TF-SB1
Football](http://spalding.com/football/index.php) when they arrive at
camp.

Please visit and support our [sponsors](/sponsors) who make these gifts
possible.
