History
=======

The Manning Passing Academy is owned and operated by the first family of
football: Archie, Cooper, Peyton and Eli Manning… and is always an
integral part of their lives. As such, their summer vacations always
revolve around the annual football camp which is celebrating its 21st
anniversary. The Mannings are always the first to arrive, and the last
to leave. They eat and sleep on-campus along with the rest of the
campers and staff.

The MPA is looking forward to its 12th year at
[Nicholls State University](https://www.nicholls.edu/manning-passing-academy/)
in Thibodaux, Louisiana. Due to the university's vast layout and
proximity of playing fields, it became a natural attraction for the MPA.
Nicholls State served as the former site of the New Orleans Saints
Training Camp, a distinction not lost on the Mannings who are always on
the lookout to improve the quality of the camp any way they can. The
concept of this camp sprang from the concern that even the most basic
fundamentals of throwing (and catching) a football were either seriously
lacking or virtually non-existent during a youngster’s developmental
years (high school). It was this concern that motivated the Mannings to
bring together some of the most successful and brightest coaches and
players from the professional, college, and high school ranks. And
although the Manning name has been practically synonymous with the
quarterback position for almost four decades, the MPA is not just for
QBs.
