<h2 id="archie-manning---executive-director">Archie Manning - Executive Director</h2>

<p>Leadership, dedication and commitment have enabled Archie Manning to succeed
both on and off the football field. Archie oversees every aspect of the Manning
Passing Academy and makes all the audibles when it comes to teaching and
coaching. Manning’s background is truly reflective of the ideals and dedication
necessary to compete on the football field.</p>

<p>At Ole Miss, where he is considered one of the greatest players ever to wear a
Rebel uniform, he was the recipient of the Walter Camp Award and was selected to
the All-American, All-SEC and All-South teams. As a professional Manning was the
2nd player selected in the 1971 NFL draft, he went on to a brilliant 14 year
career that included stints with the New Orleans Saints, Houston Oilers, and
Minnesota Vikings. As the New Orleans Saints field general, Archie was named
league MVP in `78 and was twice selected to the Pro Bowl.</p>

<p>As a community leader, he has supported numerous non-profits and charities over
the years in both Louisiana and Mississippi while continuing to assist those who
share his love for the game of football.  In 2013 he became the eighth recipient
of the NFL's prestigious "Pat Summerall Award" given to an individual who has
demonstrated through their career the character, integrity and leadership both
on and off the field.</p>

<p>Archie is Chairman of the National Football Foundation College Hall of Fame and
a member of the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and serves as an active member
of the Allstate Sugar Bowl championship committee.</p>

<p>The former All-American quarterback at Mississippi was named as the recipient of
the Davey O’Brien Legends Award which recognizes a QB who has made significant
contributions to football, distinguished himself as an extraordinary leader and
demonstrated exemplary conduct and reputation on and off the field. In October
2013, he was selected to be one of the 13 inaugural members of the College
Football Playoff Selection Committee.</p>

<p>A portion of the Manning Passing Academy proceeds is donated to Special Olympics
Louisiana, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and the Brain Tumor Research
Center. Archie and Peyton have written a book entitled "Manning: A Father, His
Sons and A Football Legacy," and also have a national quarterback award named
after the family. The Manning Award, hosted by the Sugar Bowl Committee, in
honor of Archie, Peyton and Eli is the only national quarterback award that
considered the candidates post-season play.</p>

<p>For almost four decades, the Manning family and the quarterback position have
been practically synonymous with one another. As such, their summer vacations
always revolve the annual Manning Passing Academy, a family-owned and managed
football camp that embraces the basic fundamentals of football while catering to
the offensive skill positions of RB, TE, WR…and of course QB. Archie and his
wife Olivia (a former Homecoming Queen at Ole Miss) reside in New Orleans are
the proud grandparents of seven grandchildren by Cooper, Peyton and Eli.</p>

<h2 id="cooper-manning---senior-associate-director">Cooper Manning - Senior Associate Director</h2>

<p>Cooper was a two-time All-State wide receiver at Isidore Newman School in New
Orleans and played in the Louisiana High School All-Star Game as well as
participating on two state championship basketball teams. He was heavily
recruited by Division I schools out of high school including Texas, Virginia,
and Ole Miss before deciding to attend his father’s alma mater (Ole Miss) on a
football scholarship. A career-ending injury forced the Rebel wide receiver to
the sidelines, but his love for the game has never diminished.</p>

<p>Coop’s experience in high school, college, and professional sports has made him
a natural fit for the broadcast booth and he has hosted and or cohosted numerous
projects over the years, including both television and radio shows during
football season on WWL in New Orleans.</p>

<p>One of the most popular staff members among the campers, he is never too busy to
lend instruction or a helping hand. He is always the first to arrive at camp and
the last to leave. He prides himself on his ability to entertain campers after
practice as he hosts a live Q&amp;A sessions with all the college players on staff.</p>

<p>He is currently a partner at Howard Weil Inc., an energy investment boutique in
New Orleans and is active with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, The
Academy of Sacred Heart and his alma mater Isidore Newman School. He and his
wife Ellen are the proud parents of an 11-year-old daughter May, and two sons,
Arch (10) and Heid (8). Cooper remains the most handsome Manning and has no
plans of losing that title.</p>

<h2 id="peyton-manning---senior-associate-director">Peyton Manning - Senior Associate Director</h2>

<p>A 17-year NFL veteran, Manning is widely regarded as one of the best
quarterbacks to have ever played the game as the league’s only five-time MVP
whose 13 Pro Bowl selections are the most ever by a QB.</p>

<p>Selected with the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis
Colts, Manning quickly made his presence known, setting five different NFL
rookie records, including most TDs in a season and was named to the NFL
All-Rookie First Team.</p>

<p>Manning enjoyed arguably his greatest season in 2013, earning his fifth MVP
award and making his third trip to the Super Bowl while setting  NFL
single-season records in passing yards (5,477), touchdown passes (55) and
quarterback rating (115.1).  He also set Broncos single-season records in those
categories, while his completions, yards and touchdown passes were career highs.
The Associated Press selected him as the 2013 Offensive Player of the Year and
also was the 2013 FedEx Air Player of the Year.</p>

<p>In 2012, Manning took over as QB of the Denver Broncos after spending the first
14 years of his illustrious career in Indianapolis and didn’t miss a beat after
recovering from neck surgery in 2011, leading the Broncos to an AFC best 13-3
record. He also ranked second among starting quarterbacks with a passer rating
of 105.8, third in touchdowns with 37 and accumulated 4,659 passing yards. He
set Bronco single-season passing records in nearly every major passing category.
For his accomplishments, he was recognized by the Associated Press as the 2012
NFL Comeback Player of the Year and also was named to his 12th Pro Bowl, his 6th
as a first-team selection.</p>

<p>Before missing the 2011 season due to injury, Manning started 16 regular season
games for 13 consecutive seasons and earned his 11th Pro Bowl selection in 2010.</p>

<p>As the Super Bowl XLI MVP, he has completed more passes, thrown for more yards
and touchdowns in a career-opening 13-year span than any NFL player in history
and has torched all the NFL, AFC, and Colts record-books in the process, won
back-to-back MVP honors for second time in his career (2003-04 and 2008-09),
which in itself is a record, and in 2009, he was listed by the Sporting News as
the No. 1 player in the NFL.</p>

<p>He is the only NFL QB to ever throw for 3,000+ yards in his first 13 seasons of
his career, holds NFL records for consecutive seasons with 4,000+ yards in a
career, and the Colts’ all-time career passing yards and passing touchdowns
leader.</p>

<p>As a collegian at the University of Tennessee, he was a four-year starter, saw
action in 48 games with 45 starts, set 33 school records, eight SEC records and
two NCAA marks, and ended his college career owning SEC record for wins as
starting QB (39-6), completions (863), passing yards (11,201), total offense
(11,020), and completion percentage (62.49%).</p>

<p>Ranked 3rd in NCAA history in passing yards and total offense as well as posted
a 26-4 record as a starter in SEC games, Peyton is a three-time Academic
All-America honoree, started 13 games as a senior and led his team to the SEC
Championship and an 11-2 record, and won the Sullivan Award for the nation’s top
amateur athlete, Davey O’Brien Award for Top QB, Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award
for top senior and GTE Academic All-America 1st Team.</p>

<p>Manning was selected the 2001, 2004 and 2005 Walter Payton/ Indianapolis Colts
NFL Man-of-the-Year for his participation in community affairs, he attended
Newman High School and was an All-American, All-State and All-District pick at
QB.</p>

<p>Peyton and his wife Ashley reside in Denver, Colorado and are the proud parents
of twins, Mosley and Marshal.</p>
