Camp Coaches
============

The Manning Passing Academy is overseen by the Manning family who
supervises a staff of more than 120 assistants (maintaining a player to
coach ratio of better than 10:1) and actively coach all positions
regardless of ages or ability levels. The overall staff is comprised of
past and present coaches and players from the NFL, college, and high
school ranks.

The on-field (coaching) and off-field (administrative) operations and handled
respectively by [Dartmouth College's](http://athletics.dartmouth.edu/) head
football coach Buddy Teevens and the [University of
Oregon's](http://www.goducks.com/) Senior Associate Athletic Director for
Football Administration and Operations and Director of the Hatfield-Dowlin
Complex, Jeff Hawkins. Together they boast more than 70 years of successful camp
experiences between them.

The coaching and counseling staff are further complemented with
successful college and high school coaches from across the nation as
well as outstanding college players from top programs including Alabama,
Auburn, Dartmouth, Florida, Georgia, Harvard, Jackson State, Kentucky,
LSU, Louisiana Tech, Mississippi State, Nicholls State, North Carolina
State, Ole Miss, Oregon, Oregon State, South Carolina, Southern Miss,
Stanford, Tennessee, Texas, Tulane, ULL and more.

*Due to the fact that there is so much movement in the football coaching
profession, we cannot give a full list of the coaching staff until late
June. Rest assured that, as always, they will all be of the highest quality
coaches available.*
