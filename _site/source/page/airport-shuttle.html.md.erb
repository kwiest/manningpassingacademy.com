We typically have campers from all 50 states, Canada and Mexico. The
closest airport is [New Orleans International](http://www.flymsy.com/)
(MSY). The camp site is located at Nicholls State University in
Thibodaux, Louisiana (60 miles west of New Orleans, and 60 miles north
of the Gulf Coast).

There is an airport shuttle service available for campers between Louis
Armstrong (New Orleans) Airport and Nicholls State University that costs
$60 round trip (or $30 each way). This service is provided by an outside
company and is only offered on Thursday and Sunday only.

There is a $10 fee for any shuttle cancellations.

Campers who choose to use the airport shuttle will take the airport
shuttle to the Airport Hilton. There is a holding area at the Airport
Hilton complete with TVs and complimentary refreshments. Shuttles will
leave the Airport Hilton for camp every hour.

Other than this shuttle service there is no other transportation
provided (due to insurance issues). You may want to pursue information
