Passing League
==============

All of the players in camp are broken up into teams of 7 for contests of
7-on-7. Teams and groups that come together will be afforded the
opportunity to play together. For those who come individuallyâ€¦ you will
be grouped with campers of the same grade. Everyone plays, and everyone
has fun.

*Note: Some campers would prefer to play at a higher grade-level than
the one they are in. The MPA cannot assess the skill level of a player
relative to campers of a different grade-level during camp. Therefore, a
camper will NOT be allowed to move up. However, if a camper feels that
they should be in a lower level, due to ability, experience, or because
younger teammates are in attendance, we will allow it.*
