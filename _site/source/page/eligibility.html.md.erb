Eligibility
===========

In accordance with NCAA rules on prospective student athletes, all boys
must be between the grades 8-12. That is, a prospective camper must be
entering the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th grade the fall immediately
following the MPA session. High school graduates are prohibited to
attend the MPA (per NCAA rules). Campers will be matched against other
players of the same grade.

*Note: Some campers would prefer to play at a higher grade-level than
the one they are in. The MPA cannot assess the skill level of a player
relative to campers of a different grade-level during the period that
camp is in session. Therefore, a camper will NOT be allowed to move up.
However, if a camper feels that they should be in a lower level, due to
ability, or because younger teammates are in attendance, we will allow
it.*
